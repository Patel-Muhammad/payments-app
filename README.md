This project details the deployment journey of a MERN stack application onto an Azure virtual machine. Setups involved created a **virtual machine in Azure**, **deployment** of the MERN stack application, **server configuration** employing Nginx, and integration of a **custom domain**, [payments.propatel.me](https://payments.propatel.me), through the addition of an A record. Moreover, to fortify communication security, I also installed SSL certificate via **Certbot**.
